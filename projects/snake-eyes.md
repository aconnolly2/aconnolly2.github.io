My first game jam project, Snake Eyes was developed in XNA for Global Game Jam 2012 at Chico State where the theme was “A picture of an Ouroboros.” I was the only programmer in a team of artists, which was a fun experience, as I was getting pelted with incredible artwork faster than I could implement it into the project. The end result was quite different than the initial design due to time constraints, but it was a fantastic learning experience and started my passion for game jams.
