A puzzle game developed in UDK by Chico State Game Studios, 40 Stories was submitted to IGF and received a small amount of critical acclaim. I worked on the programming team for this project, focusing on animation programming, gameplay mechanics, and tools for level designers. This was one of my favorite projects, and a game that Iâ€™m still proud of, despite it having nearly disappeared from the internet.
