My first game project developed in GameMaker for my Digital Prototyping Game Design class, Evil Tech was a bizarre mashup of various game genres. It opens with a side scrolling beat-em-up, goes into a sort of stealth-based RPG with random encounters, and finishes with a side-scrolling boss battle. While it is wildly inconsistent in theme and story, it still manages to be kind of fun, and I think the boss battle at the end still holds up (unfortunately getting to it is a slog).
