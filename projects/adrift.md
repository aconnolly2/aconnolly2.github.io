A small crew has been sent on a galactic voyage in search of habitable planets / intelligent life. Unfortunately, a mechanical error has left them stranded. This game was developed as a solo project in Unity for Global Game Jam 2015 at Chico State. It was released on the Amazon App Store as an Android app in late 2015, and is currently still available.
