You lost everything from your previous home. You got fired from your job. Your parents disowned you. Your wife left you and took the house with her. You had no friends to turn to, and it seemed like all hope was lost. You remember what your late grandmother taught you: Her recipe for the most wonderful food known to mankind. Pizza. You always kept your grandmother close to your heart. Pizza is all you know. Pizza is all you have. You move out of the country for a fresh start. You start your own pizza place. This is where you are home, because home is about being free to pursue your passion. Your passion is pizza. Home is where the pizza’s at.

This game was developed in Unity for Global Game Jam 2019 at Chico State with the theme of “What home means to you.”
