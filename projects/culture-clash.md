An arcade game featuring a bacterial organism that eats food, avoids viruses, grows, and evolves. Developed as a solo game project in Unity for Ludum Dare in Summer 2012 with the theme, “Evolution,” it was released on Kongregate, but eventually fell out of support with the Unity Web Player. This was my first complete Unity project after switching away from UDK and XNA (which was in decline at the time).
