Developed in 3D XNA/C# for PC (with dreams of going on the Xbox 360), Dynamaze utilized a modified version of a recursive division maze algorithm. A spaceship travels through mazes that grow progressively larger and more complicated while dodging mines and fighting off swarms of drones, searching for portals to advance to the next level.
