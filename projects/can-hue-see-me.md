Multiplayer tag game developed in Unity using Photon Unity Networking for Global Game Jam 2014 at Chico State with the theme of “We don’t see things as they are, we see them as we are.” The game was highly dependent on its multiplayer configuration, and the Photon server for this application is no longer available, so unfortunately it can’t be played anymore, but it was a fun and ambitious exploration of online multiplayer for a game jam.
