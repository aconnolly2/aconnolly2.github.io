A PreViz project for a motion capture class. With a small team, I acted out all the shots wearing a MoCap suit in a volume for optical capture, as well as a couple shots with an accelerometer-based X-SENS suit. As a team we cleaned up the various shots in MoBu and Maya, then did post-processing in Marmoset, and assembly in Adobe Premiere.
