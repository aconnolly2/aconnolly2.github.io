A hacker themed real-time strategy game developed in GameMaker for my Senior Game Development class. It was originally intended to be developed in XNA in 3D, but we weren’t able to learn the technology quick enough for the class’s time constraints, so the final result was a refined version of its GameMaker prototype.
