A wealthy ghost has invited you to his manor for a party where his precious artifact has been stolen. Without it, he will descend into madness and be destroyed. This game was developed in Unity for Global Game Jam 2021 by a remote team collaborating through the Chico State jam site with the theme of “Lost and Found.”
