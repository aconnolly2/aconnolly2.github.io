title: Hello World!

This isn't a default Hello World post, I swear! Well, at least that's not all it is.

I'm trying to use GitHub a bit more (since I've been using it so much for my projects lately, and I'm getting better ideas of how to integrate it with Unity), so I've finally set up a GitHub pages to see if I can bring a bit more stability to my portfolio.

Following GitHub's suggestion (and this wonderful [tutorial](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/)) I have set up a blog using Jekyll (Jekyll Now to be specific). I'm going to choose to ignore the 2014 on that blog post, and Jekyll's default post for now, but hopefully this gives me a nice functional solution for the time being while I continue finishing up my [school project](https://github.com/LoremIpsumUCD23/HoloLens-Translator) and continue progress on my own projects. Expect more details on those in the near(ish) future.
