Hello! My name is **August Connolly**. After a bit over a decade-long career as an IT administrator wearing all the hats (*Linux, Windows, Mac, Hardware, Software, Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB, Azure, AWS, Firebase, SAP, MS Project, Unity, Unreal, and somehow more...*), I'm looking to transition my career towards software development.

My undergraduate program was in **Applied Computer Graphics** (*which has been renamed to the far more descriptive **Computer Animation and Game Design***), and was where I first started developing games. I initially started in GameMaker and Javascript, picked up XNA and C#, worked in UnrealScript with UDK, and then converted to Unity with C#, where I've tried to stay ever since. (*Though I did do my data structures and algorithms courses in C++, and most of the work in my Computer Science Master's program was in Python, because ML/AI is all anyone can seem to talk about anymore*). So when I'm not working on personal game projects, or exploring AR/VR technologies, I'm mostly spending my time trying to convince employers that my 10+ years of hobbyist programming is at least a step above the zero years of professional programming experience that I have on paper.

After working through the pandemic (*in the office, alone, as essential personnel*), I decided it was time for a change, which is why I left my incredible (*and very comfortable*) job to move abroad to Ireland and go back to school. (*I also needed to go somewhere that my seasonal allergies weren't as crippling, and preferably wasn't perpetually on fire. Dublin checks both boxes... so far*). So now I'm just finishing up my program (*with just weeks left*) and searching for work that will let me stay here. That about sums it up for me. 

For some other interesting things about me outside of my career, I practice Okinawan Karate (*Godan*) and Kobudo (*Yondan*) in the Shorin-Ryu Shorin-Kan system, I used to fence Epee, but haven't recently (*I need new gear, and more time, and more energy...*), and I used to stream a lot on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/ghotifrye) (*and still do occasionally*). I love [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55240962-august-connolly), watching [movies](https://letterboxd.com/GhotiFrye/), and [TV shows](https://www.imdb.com/user/ur15925417/). Basically just a content-consuming machine. I also play flute (*classical*) and mandolin (*Irish trad lately, but also whatever else I fancy*), and I used to play the Hurdy Gurdy (*though they're difficult to travel with, and very high-maintenance instruments*). I also used to drive a motorcycle, and one day hope to get my Irish license so that I can tour the country on a bike (*with appropriate wet-weather gear of course*). Ok, well I think that's more than enough about me. If you ever want to know more, feel free to contact me. I'm persistently online.
